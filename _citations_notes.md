But they lost courage and did not take the seeds; Gandhi later said this exploit led him to think little of threats by others to commit suicide. While he was still a child Gandhi’s parents set about finding a wife for him, following the usual practice in Kathiawar (and other parts of India) of ‘betrothal’ to a suitable girl. He was betrothed three times, the death of the first two girls demonstrating why this custom prevailed: it was wise to ‘reserve’ a future spouse for fear there would be none left of appropriate caste and social standing when the time for marriage came.

Bitcoin [38] is an unofficial supranational currency that provides newly issued Bitcoin as a reward for managing a public digital ledger, called the Bitcoin blockchain, which prevents double spending. Anybody can offer computing power to update the digital ledger in return for newly issued Bitcoin - thereby becoming a Bitcoin ‘miner’.

Store of Value (PreRatification) A floating Solar Dollar price will be the result of supply-demand in open markets. The currency supply is coupled to the audited mitigation rate, and currency demand reflects social preferences and market sentiment. Store of Value (PostRatification) A scheduled Solar Dollar price will be the result of central bank purchases with a comprehensive basket of fiat currencies under an international monetary protocol for Green Quantitative Easing (GQE). Market actors will trade in Solar Dollars in foreign exchange markets, and investors will take advantage of the rising price in a scheduled multi-decade ‘bull market’. Social Agreement (PreRatification) The Solar Dollar will be issued to firms and private actors as a reward for mitigating GHG emissions (incl. industrial de-carbonization, clean energy, sequestration, and education). Solar Dollar issuance will be managed under transparent assessor-mitigator contractual relationships. Citizens will be invited to purchase Solar Dollars as a petition to political leaders and central banks for the policy. Citizens may trade with and invest in Solar Dollars. Social Agreement (PostRatification) The social agreement is similar to that for preratification, but a specific mitigation objective needs to be defined. After ratification the cost of Solar Dollar financing will be guaranteed by Central bank trading using fiat created with Green Quantitative Easing (GQE). Costs will be spread across the global economy and further absorbed by currency markets. The social agreement will involve new institutions

This objective can be fixed a priori as a ‘guardrail’. With an established guardrail, the price of 4C can respond autonomously to meet a prognostic multi-decade price schedule that addresses the guardrail. It is therefore feasible to present the 4C price as a schedule that is adjusted periodically and autonomously in response to observed changes in the economy and climate system.

As population continues to grow, the model also moves in the direction of, and ultimately projects, a long-term devolution of the national system to a form of regional reorganization and decentralization - a strategic move important not only to democracy and liberty, but to the successful democratic management of ecological and other pressing issues. Along with the strong affirmation of community, the concept of ‘subsidiarity’ - that as a rule functions should be kept at the lowest level possible, moving only to higher levels when absolutely necessary - is a guiding principle throughout. ” (Alperovitz 2012). We are now entering a historical moment where the sociopolitical opportunity for a transition from capitalism into a more egalitarian mode of accumulation is at hand (Chase-Dunn and Roberts 2012). Transnational movements challenge and reject the public’s acceptance of the preconceived notion that the means of survival for any human being should be allocated on a strictly market basis. The inherent problem with neoliberal capitalism is that it treats markets as a product of nature instead of structured relations of power and domination.“Followed to its logical conclusion, neo-liberalism as a prescription for society would mean the end of social reciprocity, of collective redistribution of the social product, an end to the family and eventually to the species itself. ” (Robinson 2014). Blockchains are a new set of exchange institutions. They serve as a sub system within global capitalism, and hold the potential to expand democracy globally11

The goal of a blockchain is to represent a single state being concurrently edited. In order to avoid con

puts by providing arguments for which their scripts evaluate to true. These arguments can be thought of keys and the scripts as padlocks. In simple transactions, such scripts are merely signature-checking scripts but more complex scripts can be formed. These outputs are added up and allocated among a set of new outputs. If the amount of output spent is greater than the amount allocated, the diﬀerence can be claimed by the miner. Changes to the transaction protocol are more controversial than changes to the network protocol. While a small group of people could unilaterally start using the cat-picture broadcast algorithm, changing the transaction protocol is trickier. Such changes typically do not aﬀect the block validity and thus only require the cooperation of a majority of the miners. These are generally referred to as \soft-fork". Some relatively uncontroversial changes still stand a chance to be imple- mented there. For instance a x to the transaction malleability issue would be a transaction protocol level change. The introduction of Zerocash, also a trans- action protocol level change, risks being too controversial to be undertaken. 2.1.3 Consensus Protocol The consensus protocol of Bitcoin describes the way consensus is built around the most diﬃcult chain and the miner reward schedules. It allows miners to draw transactions from the coin base, it dictates how diﬃculty changes over time, it indicates which blocks are valid and which are part of the \oﬃcial" chain. This is by far the most central and most diﬃcult to change protocol, often requiring a \hard-fork", that is a fork invalidating old blocks. For instance, the proof of work system, as is the reliance on SHA256 as a proof-of-work system, etc. 2.2 Network Shell Tezos separates these three protocols. The transaction protocol and the con- sensus protocol are implemented in an isolated module plugged into a generic 11

the compliance procedures of the whole trading chain would have the strength of its weakest link 1 .However, buyers might be held, at least in part, responsible for the failure of the seller. This is the question of liability. This question is already raised by the provisions of the Protocol for trading amongst Annex-I countries (see e.g.Haites, 1998 and Kerr, 1998), but could become more important if emissions trading with developing countries were developed with multi-year budget periods.Therefore, a first possible set of rules would keep the concept of multi-year periods but would make very clear that, as soon as a developing country with an emission budget starts to sell allowances, this budget becomes a firm limit. It would face non-compliance procedures if it fails to respect it limit. An alternative set of rules avoids the risk of emissions exceeding a budget after selling of some allowances, and the difficulties regarding compliance procedures and liability. Consider first the economic and environmental rationales behind the multi-year commitment period. The former is to allow Annex-I countries to smooth short-term economic cycles or climate variations – and therefore short-term emissions variations. The latter is that the precise level of emissions at a particular point of time does not matter much for the Climate. Since developing countries with emissions budgets will not face emissions limits, they do not need a multi-year budget period and one should consider the option of defining these budgets on a yearly basis.Moreover, to prevent any trading of false abatement, one could stipulate that trading could only occur at the end of each period. For the last budget period corresponding to the end of the commitment period for Annex-I countries, the “true-up” period suggested by some analysts might be a valid option. Trading allowances would thus become possible only after it appeared that the country they had been allocated to would not use them to cover its own emissions. An advantage of this second set of rules is that the emissions budgets would never turn out to be firm limits on developing countries' emissions. The drawback is that it would be 1 Let us suppose, that financial incentives for compliance be established, as suggested by OECD/AIE (1997), with different prices for developed countries (say, 100$/tCO2) and developing ones (say, 10$/tCO2).Then, a developed country short of allowances, rather than paying its due, will prefer to buy allowances to some developing country at any price under 100$/tCO2. Selling allowances at any price above 10$/tCO2 will allow the seller to pay its due while making profit.Eventually, the maximum cost paid by all countries will be 10$ and not 100$. Only emission abatements less costly than 10$/tCO2 – and not 100$ as intended – will occurHow could Emissions Trading benefit Developing Countries.Rev. 3 – 05/03/99- page 6

This will depend on whether the country as a whole is allowed to sell allowances or not. He will therefore face some difficulties in gathering the up-front money needed to finance the investment – especially if the local price of a carbon allowance is much lower than the international price. This drawback also exists with the first set of rules, to a lesser extent. After the country has committed itself to a firm limit by starting to sell allowances, investors will know that emission reductions occurring before the end of the budget period will have the value of the international price 2 . This weakness of the budget concept (as compared to “normal” emissions trading with firm limits from the onset) is precisely the strength of the Clean Development Mechanism. And the reverse is true as well, as we will see now.C. Relations between emissions budgets and the CDM The establishment of the Clean Development Mechanism (Kyoto Protocol Article 12) might be seen as an attempt to implement the preamble of the Convention that “the global nature of climate change calls for the widest possible cooperation by all countries” while fully taking into account the principle of common, but differentiated responsibilities.However, the scope of the Clean Development Mechanism is limited by the fact that it is limited to “project activities”.Moreover, a baseline needs to be established for each project activity, to ensure that the reductions in emissions are “additional to any that would occur in the absence of the certified project activity” (K.P. Article 12). The latter raises numerous difficulties, but is needed to prevent the formation of “tropical hot air” – although there might be some ways to simplify the issue (see e.g. Hargrave et al, 1998, Matsuo et al, 1998, Philibert, 1998, Puhl, 1998). This involves transaction costs, which may be relatively low for large projects, but may be too high for small projects.Moreover, estimating emissions reductions may be very difficult for some projects in certain sectors like transportation, housing or small businesses.Therefore, the Clean Development Mechanism will be in position to deal with emissions from large industries and the power sector more easily than those from other sectors. Depending on the countries, the emissions the C.DM. could address represent between 15 to 40% of the emissions of a country. 2 For that reason, countries having benefited from emissions trading in one period with an emission budget, may further consider moving to the Annex-I list for subsequent periods, as this will eliminate this drawback of the budget conceptHow could Emissions Trading benefit Developing Countries.Rev. 3 – 05/03/99- page 7

To understand this, let us suppose a developing country negotiated an emissions budget, and further allocated a part of this budget to its industries, leaving another part for housing, transport and so on. When evaluating an abatement investment, a plant manager will not know if the emission reductions will have the value of the international price of carbon allowances or the value of the local price of carbon allowances. This will depend on whether the country as a whole is allowed to sell allowances or not. He will therefore face some difficulties in gathering the up-front money needed to finance the investment – especially if the local price of a carbon allowance is much lower than the international price.

Involving developing countries in emissions trading through the negotiation of emission budgets would provide them substantial capital inflows through emissions trading, therefore stimulating their economic growth. It would also allow the World to take advantage of the fact that most of them are building their infrastructure, which would determine long term paths of greenhouse gas emissions. This would be fully in line with the provisions under the Convention, recalled above (I), that “the global nature of climate change calls for the widest possible cooperation by all countries and their participation in an effective and appropriate international response, in accordance with their common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities and their social and economic conditions

This dilemma is a fundamental problem of game theory, illustrating how players will sometimes fail to cooperate even if it was in their best interest. We see that players in ﬁnancial markets distrust each other and keep overpaying for an ineﬃcient set of various ratings, scores and audits, although these are frequently wrong (as with the Enron scandal and the subprime mortgage crisis). This ineﬃciency leads to high costs and often losses, which in turn raise the cost of capital and lead to a lack of access to capital for decentralized small businesses or borrowers. Another issue derived from this dilemma is the obstructing cost of deployment to the public market. If this barrier is removed, then the market itself is cable to evaluate every asset based on the collective wisdom of all trading participants, as the increase in volume of transparent and authentic trade operations provides more information that can be used by the market to verify the assets. We oﬀer a solution — the Proof-of-Asset Protocol, the point of which is an instant audit of the asset. Now every investor is aware of the status of his investments in non-public companies and assets. Equipped with this tool, the market will force certain businesses to change (lawyers, accounting, auditors, and in separate cases banks and collectors). What is our plan? We will begin by modernizing the mechanisms of assigning and validating ratings, as the cash ﬂow recorded on the blockchain using the Proof-ofAsset protocol is transparent, understandable, as well as much faster and cheaper. In essence, the asset’s state is being constantly monitored by the logic of smart-contracts. In turn, the increased amount of information on economical operations and their authenticity grant new opportunities for the development of an economical AI, building suﬃciently precise artiﬁcial intelligence systems for risk evaluation, making the cost of such calculations approach zero. This would enable the creation of a competitive market of economical AI working for the good of modern society. 2 Modern Financial Markets 2.1 Bank-as-a-Service (BaaS) Business Model Bank-as-a-Service (BaaS ) is a business model that makes it possible to build new ﬁnancial products that are integrated with multiple existing technological solutions and jurisdictions.

Market maker is a player on a market for a good or security who provides both buy and sell opportunities for traders, thus making this market more liquid. Market makers hold both the security/good and cash in inventories in order to be able to take the opposite side of trading order volume to ﬁx imbalance in buy and sell orders.Market-makers earn on bid-ask spreads, but bear the risks of price decline of their inventories. Key players: traders: responsible for creation of purchasing/sell orders; market makers (specialists): display public buy & sell quotations for a guaranteed number of securities/goods to traders and fulﬁll orders from traders at these quotations; dealers: buy and sell securities/goods from traders but do not disclose quotes publicly; brokers: carry out orders on behalf of their clients. Liquid trade is of great importance for the stability and eﬀectiveness of ﬁnancial markets. Market making is an established trading practice, which has inspired much research, both theoretical and empirical. Most of the theoretical research papers model market maker as a single player with whom other market players can trade, with no trading activity apart from that. On the other hand, there are some research papers where market makers compete with middlemen (dealers/brokers). In this model, the author introduces market-makers to a model by D. Spulber with buyers, sellers and dealers. A number of researchers have focused on the optimal behavior of a market maker (specialist). Some papers examine the eﬀect of risk aversion and inventory on the pricing policies of a market maker. In another paper, the authors study the proﬁtability of market making strategies. Other researchers model bid-ask spread as a need to compensate for losses due to adverse selection problem: traders who engage in trade with a market-maker might know information that the market maker does not know. Recent papers have focused on combining ﬁnancial market maker model with the ﬁeld of artiﬁcial intelligence; high frequency trading has made a signiﬁcant footprint in market-marking models. For example, Abraham Othman combines two concepts — automated market making from the artiﬁcial intelligence literature and risk measures from the ﬁnance literature. In another paper, the author studies the impact of high frequency market making on liquidity, price discovery and institutional traders’ returns. Beneﬁts of market making: liquidity provision (buyers and sellers do not need to make orders simultaneously); reduction in dealers’ bid-ask spreads due to MM publicly quoting prices; less uncertainty due to market maker displaying quotes publicly; lower search costs because traders do not need to search other traders or dealers to sell at good price; market maker can tax and subsidize transactions by changing bid and ask prices; lower transaction costs for all players due to centralized exchange; lower market volatility because ﬂuctuations of demand and supply are smoothed.9

traders: responsible for creation of purchasing/sell orders; market makers (specialists): display public buy & sell quotations for a guaranteed number of securities/goods to traders and fulﬁll orders from traders at these quotations; dealers: buy and sell securities/goods from traders but do not disclose quotes publicly; brokers: carry out orders on behalf of their clients. Liquid trade is of great importance for the stability and eﬀectiveness of ﬁnancial markets. Market making is an established trading practice, which has inspired much research, both theoretical and empirical. Most of the theoretical research papers model market maker as a single player with whom other market players can trade, with no trading activity apart from that. On the other hand, there are some research papers where market makers compete with middlemen (dealers/brokers). In this model, the author introduces market-makers to a model by D. Spulber with buyers, sellers and dealers. A number of researchers have focused on the optimal behavior of a market maker (specialist). Some papers examine the eﬀect of risk aversion and inventory on the pricing policies of a market maker. In another paper, the authors study the proﬁtability of market making strategies. Other researchers model bid-ask spread as a need to compensate for losses due to adverse selection problem: traders who engage in trade with a market-maker might know information that the market maker does not know. Recent papers have focused on combining ﬁnancial market maker model with the ﬁeld of artiﬁcial intelligence; high frequency trading has made a signiﬁcant footprint in market-marking models. For example, Abraham Othman combines two concepts — automated market making from the artiﬁcial intelligence literature and risk measures from the ﬁnance literature. In another paper, the author studies the impact of high frequency market making on liquidity, price discovery and institutional traders’ returns. Beneﬁts of market making: liquidity provision (buyers and sellers do not need to make orders simultaneously); reduction in dealers’ bid-ask spreads due to MM publicly quoting prices; less uncertainty due to market maker displaying quotes publicly; lower search costs because traders do not need to search other traders or dealers to sell at good price; market maker can tax and subsidize transactions by changing bid and ask prices; lower transaction costs for all players due to centralized exchange; lower market volatility because ﬂuctuations of demand and supply are smoothed.9

The 19th-century Scottish historian Thomas Carlyle described economics as the “dismal science” that is “dreary, desolate, and, indeed, quite abject and distressing. ” Another common misconception is that it is “all about money,” and while this has a grain of truth, it is by no means the whole picture.So, what is economics all about? The word is derived from the Greek word Oikonomia, meaning “household management,” and it has come to mean the study of the way we manage our resources, and more speciﬁcally, the production and exchange of goods and services.

United States, the top ﬁve P2P lending platforms originated USD 3.5 billion in loans in 2013, up from USD 1.2 billion in 2012. 4 As a comparison, households in the United States had around USD 858 billion in credit card debt outstanding as of December 2013, reﬂecting net new borrowing of USD 12.3 billion over the prior 12 months. Under the assumption that the USD 12.3 billion ﬁgure is a rough estimate of the growth in securitized consumer lending, this suggests that a relevant share of consumer lending net growth could be captured by P2P lending.

loan funding also appears to be related to various signals of trustworthiness. Duarte et al.(2012) ﬁnds that borrowers who appear to be more trustworthy have a higher likelihood of getting loan and being charged a relatively lower interest rate.However, trustworthy-looking borrowers, in fact, default at a lower rate and have a relatively better credit rating. Freedman and Jin (2014) observe that also having a social network is beneﬁcial for borrowers as it increases the probability of being funded and lowers the interest rate on the loan. According to Hildebrand et al.(2010), group leaders, who are rewarded for successful loan listings, have an incentive to signal borrower quality to lenders. This alleviates information asymmetries that can be mitigated if group leaders invest a substantial amount in the loans themselves

instability may induce borrowers to use crowdfunding as a source of external ﬁnance. A range of stress indicators help identify banks with potential credit supply constraints, which then can be linked to a unique, manually constructed sample of 157 new ventures seeking equity crowdfunding, for comparison with 200 ventures that do not use crowdfunding. The sample comprises projects from all major German equity crowdfunding platforms since 2011, augmented with controls for venture, manager, and bank characteristics. Crowdfunding is signiﬁcantly more likely for new ventures that interact with stressed banks. Innovative funding sources are thus particularly relevant in times of stress among conventional ﬁnanciers. But crowdfunded ventures are generally also more opaque and risky than new ventures that do not use crowdfunding. Keywords Crowdfunding ⋅ Bank stress ⋅ Funding alternative ⋅ New ventures ⋅ Credit crunch 1 Introduction Akerlof’s (1970) seminal lemons problem epitomizes the key challenge faced by any investor: how to select projects from a pool of opaque applicants.Traditionally, banks help resolve the information asymmetry between savers and investors by developing screening competences and acting as delegated monitors (Diamond 1984).

Credit scores are a common tool that banks use to evaluate ventures’ loan applications, but it is unclear if these ratings affect the availability of debt for young ventures. Robb and Robinson (2014) explore this question with U.S. data from the Kauffman Survey, and observe that information about the ventures’ past payment behavior can have a negative effect on access to ﬁnance among young ventures. Brown et al.(2012) conﬁrm this view and suggest that information provided by an external credit agency can affect the availability of ﬁnancing for young ventures; ventures with a good rating have better chances of obtaining a loan, whereas ventures with bad ratings face difﬁculties getting a loan. In line with prior literature, we expect that ventures with bad credit scores are more likely to use crowdfunding.

Does a digital currency fulﬁll these criteria? Taking Bitcoin as the general example, it is durable—its security is iron-clad and its existence is permanent in the blockchain data structure without any degradation. It is portable—it can be accessed from any internet connected computer or mobile device. It is divisible—one bitcoin can be broken down to eight decimal places (the smallest such unit known as a satoshi), and it is fungible. It has intrinsic

Hayes (2015a), however, has demonstrated that Bitcoin does have some sort of intrinsic value, directly related to its cost of production. In other words, it behaves much like a commodity produced in a competitive market: electricity goes in and bitcoin comes out. If the average cost of production decreases, producers will offer their product in the market at lower and lower prices, in competition with each other, until marginal cost approaches marginal product (Hayes 2015b).Therefore, it

For a digital, blockchain-based currency system to work as an economy’s monetary authority, some of the limitations that encumber Bitcoin must be removed. For example, Bitcoin has a predetermined maximum quantity of 21 million units. This limitation would need to be removed in favor of a potentially unlimited supply; such an upper bound will likely create an artiﬁcial constraint that ultimately serves to make it an increasingly deﬂationary currency—each ‘coin’ will become progressively more valuable as demand for money increases and the supply cannot accommodate

Theoretically, a limitation on ultimate supply seems to have no inﬂuence on a cryptocurrency’s relative value (Hayes 2015a, b). Cryptocurrencies do currently exist with no cap on the money supply, for example Peercoin, which has exhibited a fair amount of price stability despite its unlimited potential. A second hurdle to overcome is that it would be

Interest rate setting has become a hallmark of monetary policy, but there are other ways to inﬂuence the “price of money” with similar effect: a digital currency could still achieve monetary policy goals by manipulating the rate of change to new money formation to similar effect.

fractional reserve banking system like we have today in much of the developed world, the central bank regulates so-called “high powered” money, also known as the monetary base,or M0. This base is then ampliﬁed through the ﬁnancial system via lending and credit mechanisms. A digital currency system that cannot amplify itself via fractional reserve banking can still work, however.

A digital currency-based technocratic monetary authority would likely have to operate in a 100 % reserve environment.

Bitcoin has a ﬁxed rate of unit formation (one block every ten minutes), and a rule for constant predetermined growth of the money supply does happen to have some theoretical support. The so-called Friedman Rule (Friedman 1948) proposes that the central bank should establish a ﬁxed constant rate of growth for the money stock, and maintain that growth rate no matter what emerged from the state of the economy. Such a rule has some advantages: it is easy for the public to understand;

McCallum (1988) and Meltzer (1969) have augmented the constant growth rate formula with quantity-based rules that yield a dynamically changing growth rate of the monetary base contingent on widely available economic indicators.Notably, the McCallum Rule has been proposed as an alternative to the Taylor Rule, and it has been empirically shown to perform better during crises (Benchimol and Fourçans 2012). Such a rule would be much easier to implement with a digital currency system as regulator of monetary supply, since there would be no target interest rate in the traditional sense. The McCallum rule determines the optimal change in the monetary base given changes in GDP, inﬂation and the velocity of money. It is also intended to reﬂect long-lasting, permanent changes in the demand for the monetary base that occur because of technological
